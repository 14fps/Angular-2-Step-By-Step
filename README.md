# Angular 2 Step By Step With Luke Angel
## Section: Component Styles

We have the AppComponent with its metadata configured for the selector and the template URL.Let's see what we can do about giving it some style.Angular provides support for styling a component via the component metadata in two ways.Similar to how templates work,we can use either the style's property or the style URL's property.Both take an array of string values.So they are a little different than the template ones.Lets start with the styles property.

## Course Description

Angular was designed by Google to address challenges programmers face building single-page applications.
In this course Luke Angel steps through the framework one step at a time, focusing on the new component-based architecture of Angular 2. After completing this training, you'll be able to tackle the other project-based courses in our library and create your own Angular app.
JavaScript frameworks help you code more quickly, by providing special functionality for developing specific types of web projects.  This course introduces you to the essentials of this "superheroic" framework, including declarative templates, two-way data binding, and dependency injection. 

Topics include:
- What is Angular?
- Setting up an Angular template
- Creating a component
- Displaying data
- Working with events
- Using two-way data binding
- Creating a subcomponent
- Using the built-in HTTP module
- Using the built-in router module

## Instructions

1. Make sure you have these installed
  - [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
  - [git](http://git-scm.com/)

2. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (mac) or Gitbash (PC) 

    `git clone https://github.com/bTreePress/angular-2-step-by-step-beginner-to-advanced`
    
3. CD to the folder

    `cd angular2-essential-training`
    
4. Run the following to install the project dependencies:

    `npm install`
    
5. Run the npm start command to build the code, watch for file changes, and serve up the site locally:

    `npm start`

The repository has a branch for each video starting point. For example, the branch **2-1** is used as the starting code for the video *2-1 Module and *. You can checkout branches using `git checkout <branchname>` and not have to re-run `npm install` each time since you will remain in the same root folder.

Note that the site will run using `lite-server` and will be served up at the following local address:  
    http://localhost:3000

*If you use a code editor that launches its own web server please note that it may run on a different port number. 
You will want to use `npm start` for this project.*
